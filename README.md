Hi! I am Umut,
I am an 4th year industrial engineering student who focuses on data science and machine learning applications in production (both product and services) systems. 
I am proficient with python and SQL but I prefer to work with python due to its large collection of useful libraries.
I also studied operations research and have a significant experience with mathematical programming and mathematical programming softares such as GAMS and LINDO.
I am willing to colaborate on any project that can utilize my set of skills.
